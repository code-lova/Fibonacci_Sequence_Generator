# Overview

This project is a **Fibonacci Sequence Generator** built using the Rust programming language. As a software engineer aiming to broaden my skills in modern systems programming, this project helped me explore Rust’s unique memory safety model, ownership principles, and syntax.

The purpose of writing this software was to gain hands-on experience with:
- Variable bindings (mutable and immutable)
- Loops and conditionals
- Functions with ownership and borrowing
- Using a data structure (`Vec`) for dynamic storage

This project represents my foundational step in learning Rust, building confidence to create more complex CLI tools and potentially web or systems-level applications in the future.

- **Build Tool**: Cargo (Rust’s package and build manager)  
- **Language**: Rust  
- **Target Platform**: CLI (Command Line Interface)  
- **OS**: macOS/Linux/Windows (cross-platform via Rust)

# Future Work

- Add input validation for negative or non-numeric values
- Allow continuous input loop without restarting the program
- Export generated sequence to a file
- Add unit tests for the `generate_fibonacci` function
- Create a GUI version using a Rust GUI framework like `egui` or `iced`
